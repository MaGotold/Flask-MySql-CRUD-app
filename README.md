#ABOUT
Welcome to the Flask-MySQL-CRUD-App repository! This project is a RESTful API designed to demonstrate the basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations 
using Flask as the web framework and MySQL as the backend database. I built this application to deepen my understanding of building CRUD applications and designing
RESTful APIs in a practical, real-world scenario.
